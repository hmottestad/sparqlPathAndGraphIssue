# How to run

Load `export.nq` into a new stardog database. Set `query.all.graphs` to true (important).

Run the query in `query2.sparql`, check that the results are the same as in `correctResults.csv`. 

Run the query in `query1.sparql`. You will now get more results than expected.

The two sparql queries are identical expect for one running against the `all graphs` graph and the other running against a set of named graphs. The set of named graphs was automatically generated by the named graph security feature in Stardog.
